# Elm Tutorial

A tutorial for the Elm programming language, http://elm-lang.org

This is the tutorial I gave in the Dublin Elm user group's first meetup (http://www.meetup.com/Elm-User-Group-Dublin/events/226696855/).

This aims to get you started on Elm, and get you to the beginning of the Elm Architecture Tutorial (https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial)

The presentation itself uses Deckset, the source is in elm-tutorial.md
